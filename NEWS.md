OhdsiRTools v2.0.2
==================

Bugfixes:

1. Handling edge case when package has no dependencies in `takeEnvironmentSnapshot()` and `createRenvLockFile()` functions.

2. Using 'main' instead of 'master' as default branch for OHDSI study packages in `takeEnvironmentSnapshot()` and `createRenvLockFile()` functions.


OhdsiRTools v2.0.1
==================

Changes:

OhdsiRTools v2.0.0
==================

Changes:

1. `takeEnvironmentSnapshot()` and `createRenvLockFile()` now throw informative error message if root package is not found.

2. Added `auto` mode to `createRenvLockFile()` (which is now the default), which relies on `renv::init()`'s ability to scan the project for dependencies, rather than requiring the user has accurately listed all dependencies in the study package DESCRIPTION.

3. `findNonAsciiStringsInFolder()` can now also be used for non-R-script files.

4. Removing deprecated WebAPI functions, since users should now all be using the [`ROhdsiWebApi` package](https://ohdsi.github.io/ROhdsiWebApi/).

5. Deprecating `formatR...` functions in favor of `styler`.
